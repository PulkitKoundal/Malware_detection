# <span style="font-size:larger;">Malware Detection with Random Forest and Multinomial Naive Bayes</span>


This repository contains Python code for detecting malware using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Multinomial Naive Bayes. The aim is to classify executable files into legitimate and malware categories based on various features extracted from the files.

# <span style="font-size:larger;">Key features</span>
Data Processing:
The code preprocesses the dataset, separates features and target labels, and splits the data into training and testing sets.

Random Forest Classifier:
Implements a Random Forest classifier with 50 estimators for malware detection.

Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier:
Utilizes a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for comparison, providing an alternative approach to malware detection.

Evaluation Metrics:
Computes accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports to evaluate the performance of both classifiers.

Model Training and Evaluation:
Trains the models on the training data and evaluates their performance on the testing data.


# <span style="font-size:larger;">Results:</span>
The Random Forest classifier achieved an accuracy of 99.460%, while the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier achieved an accuracy of 95.1249%. Detailed evaluation metrics, including confusion matrices and classification reports, are provided in the code output.
